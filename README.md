## ReactDOM

```js
ReactDOM.render(
  element,
  container
);
```

[full documentation](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/react-dom.html)

## React
*A javascript library for building user interfaces*

```js
ReactDOM.render(
  <h1>Hello, world!</h1>,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

[live code](https://codepen.io/gingrassia/pen/PmWqNY?editors=0010)

### JSX
*Syntax extension to JavaScript. It's recommend to it with React to describe what the UI should look like. JSX may remind you of a template language, but it comes with the full power of JavaScript*

[full documentation](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/jsx-in-depth.html)

### Elements
*Elements are the smallest building blocks of React apps.
An element describes what you want to see on the screen:*

```js
const element = <h1>Hello, world</h1>;
```

```js
const element = <h1>Hello, world</h1>;

ReactDOM.render(
  element,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

[live code](https://codepen.io/gingrassia/pen/wdgazK?editors=0010)

```js
const userName = 'Pepe';
const element = <h1>Greetings, {userName}</h1>;

ReactDOM.render(
  element,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

[live code](https://codepen.io/gingrassia/pen/oWBXzQ?editors=0010)

### Components
*Components let you split the UI into independent, reusable pieces, and think about each piece in isolation.*

*Conceptually, components are like JavaScript functions. They accept arbitrary inputs (called "props") and return React elements describing what should appear on the screen*

```js
function HelloWorld() {
  return <h1>Hello, world</h1>;
}

ReactDOM.render(
  <HelloWorld />,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

[live code](https://codepen.io/gingrassia/pen/ybgNVb?editors=0010)

```js
function Greetings(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
}

ReactDOM.render(
  <Greetings name='Pepe' />,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

[live code](https://codepen.io/gingrassia/pen/oWBXYJ?editors=0010)

```js
function Greetings(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
}

const element = <Greetings name='Pepe' />;

ReactDOM.render(
  element,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

[live code](https://codepen.io/gingrassia/pen/PmWqWw?editors=0010)

#### React Components

```js
class HelloWorld extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h1>Hello, world</h1>;
  }
}

ReactDOM.render(
  <HelloWorld />,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

[live code](https://codepen.io/gingrassia/pen/eWgNge?editors=0010)

```js
class Greetings extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}</h1>;
  }
}

ReactDOM.render(
  <Greetings name='Pepe' />,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

[live code](https://codepen.io/gingrassia/pen/JNEdEa?editors=0010)

```js
class Greetings extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}</h1>;
  }
}

const element = <Greetings name='Pepe' />;

ReactDOM.render(
  element,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

[live code](https://codepen.io/gingrassia/pen/gWgpmO?editors=0010)

#### Composing Components

```js
function Welcome(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
}

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Welcome name='Pepe' />
      <Welcome name='Jose' />
      <Welcome name='Ramon' />
    </div>
  );
}

ReactDOM.render(
  <App />,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

#### Typechecking With PropTypes

```js
{
  // You can declare that a prop is a specific JS primitive. By default, these
  // are all optional.
  optionalArray: PropTypes.array,
  optionalBool: PropTypes.bool,
  optionalFunc: PropTypes.func,
  optionalNumber: PropTypes.number,
  optionalObject: PropTypes.object,
  optionalString: PropTypes.string,
  optionalSymbol: PropTypes.symbol,

  // Anything that can be rendered: numbers, strings, elements or an array
  // (or fragment) containing these types.
  optionalNode: PropTypes.node,

  // A React element.
  optionalElement: PropTypes.element,

  // You can also declare that a prop is an instance of a class. This uses
  // JS's instanceof operator.
  optionalMessage: PropTypes.instanceOf(Message),

  // You can ensure that your prop is limited to specific values by treating
  // it as an enum.
  optionalEnum: PropTypes.oneOf(['News', 'Photos']),

  // An object that could be one of many types
  optionalUnion: PropTypes.oneOfType([
    PropTypes.string,
    PropTypes.number,
    PropTypes.instanceOf(Message)
  ]),

  // An array of a certain type
  optionalArrayOf: PropTypes.arrayOf(PropTypes.number),

  // An object with property values of a certain type
  optionalObjectOf: PropTypes.objectOf(PropTypes.number),

  // An object taking on a particular shape
  optionalObjectWithShape: PropTypes.shape({
    color: PropTypes.string,
    fontSize: PropTypes.number
  }),

  // You can chain any of the above with `isRequired` to make sure a warning
  // is shown if the prop isn't provided.
  requiredFunc: PropTypes.func.isRequired,

  // A value of any data type
  requiredAny: PropTypes.any.isRequired,

  // You can also specify a custom validator. It should return an Error
  // object if the validation fails. Don't `console.warn` or throw, as this
  // won't work inside `oneOfType`.
  customProp: function(props, propName, componentName) {
    if (!/matchme/.test(props[propName])) {
      return new Error(
        'Invalid prop `' + propName + '` supplied to' +
        ' `' + componentName + '`. Validation failed.'
      );
    }
  },

  // You can also supply a custom validator to `arrayOf` and `objectOf`.
  // It should return an Error object if the validation fails. The validator
  // will be called for each key in the array or object. The first two
  // arguments of the validator are the array or object itself, and the
  // current item's key.
  customArrayProp: PropTypes.arrayOf(function(propValue, key, componentName, location, propFullName) {
    if (!/matchme/.test(propValue[key])) {
      return new Error(
        'Invalid prop `' + propFullName + '` supplied to' +
        ' `' + componentName + '`. Validation failed.'
      );
    }
  })
}
```

Usage:

```js
class Greetings extends React.Component {
  render() {
    let {age, name} = this.props;

    return <span>Hi! I am {name} and I am {age} years old</span>;
  }
}

Greetings.propTypes = {
  name: React.PropTypes.string.isRequired,
  age: React.PropTypes.number.isRequired
};

ReactDOM.render(
  <Greetings name='Pepe' age={30} />,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

[live code](https://codepen.io/gingrassia/pen/LyxxOp?editors=0010)

#### Default Prop Values
_You can define default values for your props by assigning to the special defaultProps property_

Usage:

```js
class Greetings extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}</h1>
    );
  }
}

Greetings.propTypes = {
  name: React.PropTypes.string
};

Greetings.defaultProps = {
  name: 'Stranger'
};

ReactDOM.render(
  <Greetings />,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

[live code](https://codepen.io/gingrassia/pen/VbPPKv?editors=0010)

#### Lists and Keys

This is wrong!

```js
function NumberList(props) {
  let listItems = props.numbers.map((number) =>
    <li>{number}</li>
  );

  return (
    <ul>{listItems}</ul>
  );
}

const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
ReactDOM.render(
  <NumberList numbers={numbers} />,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```
[live code](https://codepen.io/gingrassia/pen/WjRpPN?editors=0010)

Solution:

##### Keys
_Keys help React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed. Keys should be given to the elements inside the array to give the elements a stable identity_

```js
function NumberList(props) {
  let listItems = props.numbers.map((number) => (
    <li key={number.toString()}>{number}</li>
  ));

  return (
    <ul>{listItems}</ul>
  );
}

const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
ReactDOM.render(
  <NumberList numbers={numbers} />,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

#### Component Lifecycle
_Each component has several "lifecycle methods" that you can override to run code at particular times in the process. Methods prefixed with will are called right before something happens, and methods prefixed with did are called right after something happens_

##### Mounting

These methods are called when an instance of a component is being created and inserted into the DOM:

  - constructor()
  - componentWillMount()
  - render()
  - componentDidMount()

##### Updating

An update can be caused by changes to props or state. These methods are called when a component is being re-rendered:

  - componentWillReceiveProps()
  - shouldComponentUpdate()
  - componentWillUpdate()
  - render()
  - componentDidUpdate()

##### Unmounting

This method is called when a component is being removed from the DOM:

  - componentWillUnmount()

[full documentation](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/react-component.html)

#### Component State
_The heart of every React component is its "state", an object that determines how that component renders & behaves. In other words, "state" is what allows you to create components that are dynamic and interactive_

```js
class Clock extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);

    this.state = {date: new Date()};
  }

  componentDidMount() {
    this.timerID = setInterval(
      () => this.tick(),
      1000
    );
  }

  componentWillUnmount() {
    clearInterval(this.timerID);
  }

  tick() {
    this.setState({
      date: new Date()
    });
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Hi, I am a clock!</h1>
        <h2>It is {this.state.date.toLocaleTimeString()}.</h2>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

ReactDOM.render(
  <Clock />,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

[live code](https://codepen.io/gingrassia/pen/YVNRgN?editors=0010)

#### Handling Events
_Handling events with React elements is very similar to handling events on DOM elements. There are some syntactic differences_

* _React events are named using camelCase, rather than lowercase._
* _With JSX you pass a function as the event handler, rather than a string._

```js
class Toggle extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);

    this.state = { isToggleOn: true };
  }

  handleClick() {
    let {isToggleOn} = this.state;

    this.setState({
      isToggleOn: !isToggleOn
    });
  }

  handleClickV2() {
    this.setState(prevState => ({
      isToggleOn: !prevState.isToggleOn
    }));
  }

  render() {
    let {isToggleOn} = this.state;

    // This binding is necessary to make `this` work in the callback
    return (
      <div>
        <button onClick={this.handleClick.bind(this)}>
          Button 1 {isToggleOn ? 'ON' : 'OFF'}
        </button>
        <button onClick={this.handleClickV2.bind(this)}>
          Button 2 {isToggleOn ? 'ON' : 'OFF'}
        </button>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

ReactDOM.render(
  <Toggle />,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

### Thinking in React

1. Break The UI Into A Component Hierarchy
2. Build A Static Version in React
3. Identify The Minimal (but complete) Representation Of UI State
  - Is it passed in from a parent via props? If so, it probably isn't state
  - Does it remain unchanged over time? If so, it probably isn't state
  - Can you compute it based on any other state or props in your component? If so, it isn't state
4. Identify Where Your State Should Live
  - Identify every component that renders something based on that state
  - Find a common owner component (a single component above all the components that need the state in the hierarchy)
  - Either the common owner or another component higher up in the hierarchy should own the state
  - If you can't find a component where it makes sense to own the state, create a new component simply for holding the state and add it somewhere in the hierarchy above the common owner component
5. Add Inverse Data Flow

### Creating React Apps on Eventbrite

### Higher-Order Components
_A higher-order component (HOC) is an advanced technique in React for reusing component logic. HOCs are not part of the React API, per se. They are a pattern that emerges from React's compositional nature_

_Concretely, **a higher-order component is a function that takes a component and returns a new component**_

```js
const EnhancedComponent = higherOrderComponent(WrappedComponent);
```

_Whereas a component transforms props into UI, a higher-order component transforms a component into another component_

```js
const higherOrderComponent = (WrappedComponent) => (
  class EnhancedComponent extends React.Component {
    render() {
      let newProps = {
        greetings: 'I\'m a Super Hello World!'
      };

      return (
        <WrappedComponent {...this.props} {...newProps} />
      );
    }
  }
);

class HelloWorld extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <h1>{this.props.greetings}</h1>
    );
  }
}

const EnhancedHelloWorld = higherOrderComponent(HelloWorld);

ReactDOM.render(
  <EnhancedHelloWorld />,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```
[live code](https://codepen.io/gingrassia/pen/pPXEaq?editors=0010)

```js
const higherOrderComponent = () => (WrappedComponent) => (
  class EnhancedComponent extends React.Component {
    render() {
      let newProps = {
        greetings: 'I\'m a Super Hello World!'
      };

      return (
        <WrappedComponent {...this.props} {...newProps} />
      );
    }
  }
);

@higherOrderComponent()
class HelloWorld extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <h1>{this.props.greetings}</h1>
    );
  }
}

ReactDOM.render(
  <HelloWorld greetings='Hello World!' />,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

## Flux
_Flux is a pattern for managing data flow in your application. The most important concept is that data flows in one direction. As we go through this guide we'll talk about the different pieces of a Flux application and show how they form unidirectional cycles that data can flow through_

#### Flux Parts

- Dispatcher
- Store
- Action
- View

##### Dispatcher

The dispatcher receives actions and dispatches them to stores that have
registered with the dispatcher. **Every store will receive every action.**
There should be only one singleton dispatcher in each application.

Example:

1. User types in title for a todo and hits enter.
2. The view captures this event and **dispatches** an "add-todo" action
   containing the title of the todo.
3. **Every store** will then receive this action.

##### Store

A store is what holds the data of an application. Stores will register
with the application's dispatcher so that they can receive actions. **The
data in a store must only be mutated by responding to an action.** There
should not be any public setters on a store, only getters. Stores decide
what actions they want to respond to. **Every time a store's data changes it
must emit a "change" event.** There should be many stores in each
application.

Examples:

1. Store receives an "add-todo" action.
2. It decides it is relevant and adds the todo to the list of things
   that need to be done today.
3. The store updates its data and then emits a "change" event.

##### Actions

Actions define the internal API of your application. They capture the ways
in which anything might interact with your application. They are simple
objects that have a "type" field and some data.

Actions should be semantic and descriptive of the action taking place.
They should not describe implementation details of that action. Use
"delete-user" rather than breaking it up into "delete-user-id",
"clear-user-data", "refresh-credentials" (or however the process works).
Remember that all stores will receive the action and can know they need
to clear the data or refresh credentials by handling the same "delete-user"
action.

Examples:

1. When a user clicks "delete" on a completed todo a single "delete-todo"
   action is dispatched:

```js
  {
    type: 'delete-todo',
    todoID: '1234',
  }
```

##### Views

Data from stores is displayed in views. Views can use whatever framework
you want (In most examples here we will use React). **When a view uses data
from a store it must also subscribe to change events from that store.** Then
when the store emits a change the view can get the new data and re-render.
If a component ever uses a store and does not subscribe to it then there
is likely a subtle bug waiting to be found. Actions are typically dispatched
from views as the user interacts with parts of the application's interface.

Example:

1. The main view subscribes to the TodoStore.
2. It accesses a list of the Todos and renders them in a readable format for
   the user to interact with.
3. When a user types in the title of a new Todo and hits enter the view tells
   the Dispatcher to dispatch an action.
4. All stores receive the dispatched action.
5. The TodoStore handles the action and adds another Todo to its internal
   data structure, then emits a "change" event.
6. The main view is listening for the "change" event. It gets the event,
   gets new data from the TodoStore, and then re-renders the list of Todos
   in the user interface.

##### Flow of data

We can piece the parts of Flux above into a diagram describing how data flows
through the system.

1. Views send actions to the dispatcher.
2. The dispatcher sends actions to every store.
3. Stores send data to the views.
  - _(Different phrasing: Views get data from the stores.)_

![Data flow within Flux application](./flux-simple-f8-diagram-with-client-action-1300w.png)

_(There is also another node in the diagram accounting for actions that do not
originate from views, which is common)_
